## About me
I love math, philosophy, fiction and basically any type of science, learning is awesome and I never wish to stop!

Though my deteriorating eyesight has made it a struggle, I still try to read as much as I can, with my favorite genres being psychological/philosophical horror and complex mysteries.<br>
I absolutely loved **Think of a Number by John Verdon** and its sequels, got any similar suggestions for me?

## Development
I lean toward backend, but can manage the whole stack.<br>
I believe cyber-security should be learned by any programmer, and categorized as a top priority every. step. of the way.

I'm a fast learner who's constantly fidgeting around testing out different systems, frameworks, etc.<br>
That being said, I do know the importance of strengthening your bases, as just randomly learning a bit of everything is not enough.

As someone who worked with low-code systems for quite a few years:
- Low-Code development is still software development! It can be just as complex, and when working around restricted systems, even tougher.
- I'm no "mere developer", with experience in both low-code frameworks and traditional pro-code, I can say I'm a strong **All-Rounder!**

I have experience with software development, web hosting, network management, software and (a bit of) hardware repairs, and cyber-security.<br>
Whatever you're working on, I may be able to join, or at least, I can promise to catch up **rapidly**.

## Career
I started my programming journey back in 2013, learned the basics from my father, and quickly took over his projects.<br>
I worked freelance, selling content management systems specifically tailored to my clients' needs, using my father's business as proxy.

Most my works were based on [Claris FileMaker](https://www.claris.com/filemaker/), and so, I have quite a bit of experience with relational databases.

Being the sole developer, I was responsible for client communications, system design, graphics, development, networking, security, upkeep, server management, and tech support.<br>
It was a lot, and I'm glad for it!

In the army, medical complications have prevented my assignment to a cyber unit, and so I was sent to manage the networks and IT repairs for the Gaza division of the IDF. During my service I have undergone a network administration course and received a Windows technician's certificate (which I need to find ðŸ˜…).

Today, I'm working part-time for one of my clients, releasing new features, upgrading their servers, managing their networks, securing vulnerabilities - Definitely still developing software, but doing a whole lot more around it.
